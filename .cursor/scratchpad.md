# Background and Motivation
- Implement PWA (Progressive Web App) with Web Push Notifications ✅
- Allow users to install QERO CRM to their phone's home screen ✅
- Get push notifications when someone sends a chat message ✅
- Chat realtime stabilized ✅
- **Make follow-ups and status PERSONAL per user (not shared across team)** ✅

# Key Challenges and Analysis

## Personal Follow-ups & Status ✅
Previously, `status`, `follow_up_at`, and `follow_up_note` were stored directly on the `contacts` and `tma_candidates` tables. This meant when User A set a follow-up, User B saw it too.

**Solution implemented:** Created junction tables that store per-user settings:

```sql
user_contact_settings (
  user_id     → profiles.id
  contact_id  → contacts.id  
  status      → 'hot' | 'working' | 'follow_up' | null
  follow_up_at → timestamp
  follow_up_note → text
)

user_tma_settings (
  user_id     → profiles.id
  tma_id      → tma_candidates.id
  status      → 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | null
  follow_up_at → timestamp
  follow_up_note → text
)
```

# High-level Task Breakdown

## Task 19: Personal Follow-ups & Status ✅

### Step 1: Create database migration ✅
- Created `user_contact_settings` table
- Created `user_tma_settings` table
- Added indexes for efficient querying
- Set up RLS policies

### Step 2: Update Contacts API routes ✅
- Modified `data-service.ts` to merge personal settings with contact data
- Created `personal-settings-service.ts` for managing user-specific settings
- Status filter now works with personal settings

### Step 3: Update TMA API routes ✅
- Same pattern as contacts
- Personal status/follow-up merged with TMA data

### Step 4: Update Follow-ups API ✅
- Modified `/api/followups` to query from `user_contact_settings` and `user_tma_settings`
- Each user only sees their own follow-ups

### Step 5: Update types and test ✅
- Build passes
- TypeScript checks pass

# Project Status Board

# Current Status / Progress Tracking
- **All planned tasks complete!**
- Personal follow-ups and status are now per-user
- Deployed to Vercel

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- None - awaiting user testing

# Lessons
- VAPID keys are free to generate
- Service worker must be at root (public/sw.js)
- iOS Safari has some limitations with Web Push (requires iOS 16.4+)
- Batching API requests dramatically reduces Supabase usage
- `src/app/favicon.ico` overrides `public/favicon.ico` in Next.js app router
- Use object destructuring instead of `delete` operator for TypeScript compatibility
